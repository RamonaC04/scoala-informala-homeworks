	In 2007, the hotel industry in the county of Cluj offered total accommodations of 6,472 beds, of which 3,677 were in hotels, 1,294 in guesthouses and the rest in chalets, campgrounds, or hostels.[160] A total of 700,000 visitors, 140,000 of whom were foreigners, stayed overnight.[160] However, a considerable share of visits is made by those who visit Cluj-Napoca for a single day, and their exact number is not known. The largest numbers of foreign visitors come from Hungary, Italy, Germany, the United States, France, and Austria.[160] Moreover, the city's 140 or so travel agencies help organise domestic and foreign trips; car rentals are also available.[161]

	During the 16th century the city became the chief cultural and religious centre of Transylvania;[163] in the 1820s and the first half of the 1830s, Kolozsvár was the most important centre for Hungarian theatre and opera,[164] while at the beginning of the 20th century, still a Hungarian city, it became the chief alternative to the cinematography of Budapest.[165] After its incorporation into the Kingdom of Romania at the end of World War I, the renamed Cluj saw a resurgence of its Romanian culture, most conspicuous in the completion of the monumental Orthodox cathedral in 1933 across from the (newly nationalised) Romanian National Theatre.[166] This marked an unambiguously "Romanian" centre, a few blocks to the east of the old Hungarian centre;[166] however, the Romanian-ness of the town—like the Romanian hold on Transylvania—was by no means securely established even by the end of the interwar period.[166] The late 1960s brought a revival of nationalist discourse, concomitant with the urbanisation and industrialisation of the city that gradually advanced the Romanianisation of the city.[167] Nowadays, the city is home to people of different cultures, with corresponding cultural institutions such as the Hungarian State Theatre, as well as the British Council and various other centres for the promotion of foreign cultures. These institutions hold eclectic manifestations in honour of their cultures, including Bessarabian,[168] Hungarian,[169] Tunisian,[170] and Japanese.[171] Nevertheless, contemporary cultural manifestations cross ethnic boundaries, being aimed at students, cinephiles, and arts and science lovers, among others.
