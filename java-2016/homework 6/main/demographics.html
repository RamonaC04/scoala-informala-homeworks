	<h1>Demographics</h1>
	<p>	The city's population, at the 2011 census, was 324,576 inhabitants,[6] or 1.6% of the total population of Romania. The population of the Cluj-Napoca metropolitan area is estimated at 411,379.[3][7] Finally, the population of the peri-urban area numbers over 420,000 residents.[3][8] The new metropolitan government of Cluj-Napoca became operational in December 2008.[9] According to the 2007 data provided by the County Population Register Service, the total population of the city is as high as 392,276 people.[10] The variation between this number and the census data is partially explained by the real growth of the population residing in Cluj-Napoca, as well as by different counting methods: "In reality, more people live in Cluj than those who are officially registered", Traian Rotariu, director of the Center for Population Studies, told Foaia Transilvană.[10] Moreover, this number does not include the floating population—an average of over 20 thousand people each year during 2004–2007, according to the same source.</p>

	<p>In the modern era, Cluj's population experienced two phases of rapid growth, the first in the late 19th century, when the city grew in importance and size, and the second during the Communist period, when a massive urbanisation campaign was launched and many people migrated from rural areas and from beyond the Carpathians to the county's capital.[120] About two-thirds of the population growth during this era was based on net migration inflows; after 1966, the date of Ceaușescu's ban on abortion and contraception, natural increase was also significant, being responsible for the remaining third.[66]</p>

	<p>From the Middle Ages onwards, the city of Cluj has been a multicultural city with a diverse cultural and religious life. According to the 2011 Romanian census, of those for whom data are available, 81.5% of the population of the city are ethnic Romanians, with the second largest ethnic group being the Hungarians, who make up 16.4% of the population. The remainder is composed of Romani (1.1%), Germans (0.18%), Jews (0.05%) and others (0.7%). (Those for whom data were unavailable accounted for 7.1%.)[119] Today, the city receives a large influx of migrants: 25,000 people requested residence in the city during 2007.[121]</p>

	<p>In terms of religion, among those for whom there were data, 71.3% of the population in 2011 were Romanian Orthodox and 10.6% were Reformed. The Roman Catholic and the Romanian Greek-Catholic communities claimed 5.0% and 4.7% of the population respectively, while other religious groups like Pentecostals (2.7%), Baptists (1.2%), or Unitarians (1.0%) rounded out most of the rest. (Data were unavailable for 7.9% of inhabitants.)[122] By contrast, in 1930, the city was 26.7% Reformed, 22.6% Greek Catholic, 20.1% Roman Catholic, 13.4% Jewish, 11.8% Orthodox, 2.4% Lutheran and 2.1% Unitarian.[123] Contributing factors for these shifts were the extermination[124] and emigration[125] of the city's Jews, the outlawing of the Greek-Catholic Church (1948–89)[126] and the gradual decline in the Hungarian population.</p>
