	<h2>	Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Cluj-Napoca">Politics of Cluj-Napoca</a></h2>
	<p>The city government is headed by a mayor.[92] Since 2012, the office is held by Emil Boc, who was returned at that year's local election for a third term, having resigned in 2008 to become Prime Minister.[69] Decisions are approved and discussed by the local government (consiliu local) made up of 27 elected councillors.[92] The city is divided into 15 districts (cartiere) laid out radially. City hall intends to develop local administrative branches for most of the districts.</p>

	</p>As of 2011, 324,576 inhabitants live within the city limits, marking a slight increase from the figure recorded at the 2002 census.[4][6] The Cluj-Napoca metropolitan area has a population of 411,379 people, while the population of the peri-urban area (Romanian: zona periurbana) exceeds 420,000 residents. The new metropolitan government of Cluj-Napoca became operational in December 2008. According to a 2007 estimate provided by the County Population Register Service, the city hosts a visible population of students and other non-residents—an average of over 20,000 people each year during 2004–2007. The city spreads out from St. Michael's Church in Unirii Square, built in the 14th century and named after the Archangel Michael, the patron saint of Cluj-Napoca. The boundaries of the municipality contain an area of 179.52 square kilometres (69.31 sq mi).</p>
	<p>Cluj-Napoca experienced a decade of decline during the 1990s, its international reputation suffering from the policies of its mayor at the time, Gheorghe Funar.[12] Today, the city is one of the most important academic, cultural, industrial and business centres in Romania. Among other institutions, it hosts the country's largest university, Babes-Bolyai University, with its famous botanical garden; nationally renowned cultural institutions; as well as the largest Romanian-owned commercial bank. In 2015, Cluj-Napoca was European Youth Capital.
